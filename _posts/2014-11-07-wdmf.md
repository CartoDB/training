# Battle of Fallen Timbers

![Location of battle](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Fallen_Timbers_Battlefield.jpg/250px-Fallen_Timbers_Battlefield.jpg)

### 1794

General Anthony Wayne (1745-96) led American troops in a battle against a confederation of Native Americans whose leaders included Chief Little Turtle (Miami), Chief Blue Jacket (Shawnee) and Chief Buckongahelas (Lenape). The fighting took place on the Maumee River, near present-day Toledo. [source](http://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/battle-of-fallen-timbers)

The battle of Fallen Timbers had ramifications that stretched all the way to Europe. The Treaty of Greenville, negotiated between Wayne and Little Turtle the following year, secured most of what is now Ohio for American settlement. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fallen_Timbers)

# Battle of the Little Bighorn

![The Custer Fight](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Charles_Marion_Russell_-_The_Custer_Fight_%281903%29.jpg/300px-Charles_Marion_Russell_-_The_Custer_Fight_%281903%29.jpg)

### 1876

The Battle of the Little Bighorn, commonly referred to as Custer's Last Stand, was an armed engagement between combined forces of the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes, against the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army.

It was an overwhelming victory for the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho, led by several major war leaders, including Crazy Horse and Chief Gall, inspired by the visions of Sitting Bull. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Little_Bighorn)

# Wounded Knee Massacre

### Black Elk - medicine man - Oglala Lakota

"I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud, and was buried in the blizzard. A people's dream died there. It was a beautiful dream ... the nation's hope is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead." [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre)
