## Brief introduction to CartoDB

* Tour of dashboard
* Common data
* Public profile
* Workflow

## Let's Get Mapping!

Here, we'll make a map of world earthquakes. You can grab the data from Common Data in your account, you can find the link to Common Data up top.

* Table and map view
* Changing data attributes/manipulating data
* Styling data using the GUI
* Torque
* Popup/Hover windows
* Legends
* Basemaps
* Publishing

## Let's Go a Little Deeper...

Navigate back to your dashboard.

###Creating Multi-Layered Maps

How to import from a URL:
First **right click** and 'copy' [this link](https://github.com/namessanti/workshop-data/blob/master/city_council_districts.zip?raw=true) for NYC borough boundaries

* Types of uploads supported
* Adding a table
* Creating a visualization

Adding a layer (table) from local source:
Click [this link](https://github.com/namessanti/workshop-data/blob/master/rat_sightings_2263.zip?raw=true) to download the NYC rat sightings shapefile on to your computer

* Map hierarchy
* Styling multiple layers

##Your First Choropleth!

* Column Join VS Spatial Join
* Spatial join City Council Districts with Rat Sightings
* Visualizing point information in polygons


## Publishing maps

* Visualizations
* Labels and annotations
* Layout
* Publishing options

## CartoDB Advanced: Built in APIs

* filters and SQL
* CartoCSS
* Editing legends and windows with HTML
* Manually adding data
* Intro to [Odyssey.js](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/)
* Example of Odyssey.js: [The Berlin Story](http://bl.ocks.org/namessanti/raw/d5cf706f68b7c6dce9a3/)

###Don't be afraid to explore the possibilities behind our powerful APIs using these **CartoDB advanced resources**:

* The [CartoDB Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com/) is great for recapping the basics, starting to use our APIs, and growing your design capabilities
* This handy [CartCSS Reference Sheet](http://ebrelsford.github.io/talks/2014/Methods3/week7/materials/cartocss-reference.pdf) is a quick guide for beginners to CartoCSS
* This [blog post](http://blog.cartodb.com/berlin-wall-post/) talks about how I made the Berlin Story
* This [video and tutorial](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/documentation/) will quickly help you take your Odyssey.js stories to the next level
* If you have any questions or need any help, I am also available as a resource! Please email me at santiago@cartodb.com

##The Challenge!

Take your new found knowledge and create your own map or map series that tells a data story relevant to your work and interests!

Your presentation should contain 5 main elements:
* A researched and well constructed narrative
* consistency between visual elements and story: Your map must tell a **visual data story**!
* Conveys a firm grasp of CartoDB basics by using 2 or more of the skills learned today
* An **attempt** at advanced functions or design using provided resources above
* A walkthrough of the process for achieving the final map

Here are some examples of data stories:
* [Walmart Nation](http://cdb.io/113rw46)
* [Violence in Africa: October 2014](http://cdb.io/1yYw8Ux)
* [After The Fall](http://cdb.io/1yjVagF)

##Data

[Here](http://geox4.neocities.org/) is a link to a [huge resource](http://geox4.neocities.org/) for data across the web. It is broken down into International resources, US based resources, and NYC based resources. **Remember - shapefiles (.shp) must be zipped with all the files before importing to CartoDB**

Here's a link to [NYC Open Data Portal](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/) where you can search for and download data about NYC (Simply go to export at the top right when a data set is open and download as a shapefile or CSV)

#Day 2

Today will be reserved for presentations, Q & A, and a discussion about the platform, challenges, and feedback with myself and guest reviewer Vanessa Hamer

Happy Mapping!
