<p>Today we will explore various intermediate methods and features using the CartoDB UI and our JavaScript API CartoDB.js by exploring specific map examples and how the outcome is achieved.</p>

<p>A few things to note about the map:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data was scraped using the <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com">Kimono API builder</a>.</li>
  <li>The title and text boxes were made using the ‘add element’ icon on the top right of the editor.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/pratt//element_button.png" alt="Add Element" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Here you can also add annotations. Check out this <a href="http://cdb.io/1yjVagF">“After The Fall”</a> map to see how they can be used.</li>
  <li>This map has no basemap, but uses another data layer as the base. You can change your base maps, add your own images, or remove the base map using the “base map selector” in the lower left corner of the editor.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/common/basemap_options.png" alt="Basemaps" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The stylings of the map was done entirely in <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/carto/blob/master/docs/latest.md">CartoCSS</a></li>
  <li>The Torque animation elements are clickable. This is not a functionality available in Torque at the moment but you can duplicate the same layer, make it transparent on top of your animation, and style the infowindows accordingly</li>
  <li>There is a header image embedded into the infowindows on click</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Let’s take a moment to check out what this map looks like in the data table and in the editor.</strong></p>

<p>Take this time to ask questions about style, technique, or anything else that may come to mind regarding your own project or how I achieved certain elements in the map.</p>

<p>This map combines multiple layers, and many of the features were created using the built in “Add feature” function</p>

<p><img src="/img/pratt/add_feature.png" alt="Add Feature" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new layer in your project and experiment with making new features.</li>
  <li>Take a look at what they look like in the data table. You can add columns with information to these spatial features in order to generate your own styles, categories, or info windows.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>It updates every hour to let you know where storms have been reported and where there they’re headed.
This is done by importing data from a URL.</li>
  <li>real-time sync is available only in paid accounts (unless you contact us as and you’re doing something super awesome).</li>
  <li>This map also contains a custom legend created using the built in HTML editor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Let’s take another moment for questions and to tackle challenges. While I understand not everyone is HTML-savvy, a quick tutorial on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> will get you going in no time : )</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The data was styled in the CartoDB Editor, then the viz.json file was pulled out using the ‘share’ button in the upper right hand corner.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/common/share.png" alt="share" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>CartoDB.js was used to create a layer selector, and toggle map legends, which were also created in the JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to check out our <a href="http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/cartodb-js.html">documentation</a> about CartoDB.js to get started coding your own maps</p>

<p>Here are some examples of additional data stories:</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p><a href="http://geox4.neocities.org/">geox4.neocities.org/</a> is a a great resource for accessing data across the web. It is organized into the following sections: International Resources, US-based Resources, and NYC-based Resources. <strong>Remember - shapefiles (.shp) must be zipped with all the files before importing to CartoDB.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/">NYC Open Data Portal</a> is a place where you can search for and download data about NYC. Simply click on “Export” at the top right when a data set is open to download the data as a shapefile or CSV.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Mapping!</strong></p>
