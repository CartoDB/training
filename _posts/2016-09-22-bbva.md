## Builder <a name="builder"></a>

The Builder is the new main web interface to interact with the CARTO platform. It's a product aimed to everyone willing to manage, analyze and visualize geospatial information. It's highly focused on usability, with a friendly graphical interface that unlocks all the power of the CARTO Engine without having to know all the details on underlying technologies such as PostGIS or CartoCSS.

----

### Analysis exercise: railways risk analysis<a name="railways"></a>

* *Degree of Difficulty*: ***
* *Goal*: what US counties have higher risk for insuring railroad companies.
* *Features Highlighted*:
  * Widgets: Category, Formula and Time Series.
  * Analysis: Intersect, Outliers & Cluster analysis.
* *Datasests needed*:
  * Railroad accidents (**`dot_rail_safety_data`**): download it [from the `builder-demo` CARTO account](https://team.carto.com/u/ramirocartodb/tables/builder-demo.dot_rail_safety_data_1/public/map?redirected=true) and import it into CARTO from your local machine.
  * US counties (**`cb_2013_us_county_500k`**): search and connect via Data Library.

<br>

#### 1. Import and create a map

* Import the `dot_rail_safety_data` csv file into your dataset dashboard.
* Create a new map with it
* You should have a dashboard like this:

![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328904/6ad50596-58c0-11e6-8410-b4495ff40a7a.png)

<br>

#### 2. Style layer

* `FILL`: click on the marker size, select `BY VALUE`, set `total_damage` as the variable and choose a color.
* Change the `STROKE` to 0.
* Switch to `VALUES` to `CARTOCSS`. With the CartoCSS panel advanced users are allowed to layer style in a more precise way.

> Switch to the CartoCSS view and check how the quantitative map has been defined. You'll see a `ramp()` function. This is TurboCarto, our CartoCSS processor that helps creating parametric symbolization based on column values. Learn more about TurboCarto in this [awesome blog post](https://carto.com/blog/styling-with-turbo-carto/) by our senior cartographer [Mamata Akella](https://mamataakella.carto.com).

<br>

#### 3. Add widgets

##### 3. 1. Back to the main menu, select `WIDGETS`

* `ADD WIDGET`:
  * *Railroad Companies Category Widget*: select `Category`, choose `railroad`, and click on `CONTINUE`. In order to rename the widget, come back to the list of widgets and double click on the name and rename it as "Railroad Companies".
    * Take a look on how CARTO Builder sets a connection between vizualization and widgets. This connection is bidirectional, the map changes widgets values and clicking on categories changes the map.
    * Click on the `Auto style` droplet button to see how each dot is colored according to its category.
    * Disable the `Auto style` to come back to the default visualization.

![3-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328916/7bb75904-58c0-11e6-9034-a341bfd8f27c.png)

* *Total Damage Formula Widget*: select `Formula`, choose `total_damage`, and click on `CONTINUE` and set `OPERATION` to `sum` and add `$` as `PREFIX`. In order to rename the widget, come back to the list of widgets and double click on the name and rename it as "Total damage".
    * Again, experimient with the connection between visualization and widgets.
    * Try to filter by company and see how the total damage widget is updated automatically.
    * Change the order of the widgets, you can prioritize visually one over another.

![3-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328921/7fb32b6e-58c0-11e6-8b8a-951060579d0b.png)

* *Date Time Series Widget*: select `Time Series`, choose `date`, and click on `CONTINUE` in order to rename the widget.

![3-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328927/84d65562-58c0-11e6-93cc-734f39349667.png)

<br>

#### 4. Add US counties layer, start the analysis

##### 4. 1. Back to the main menu, select `LAYERS`, then `ADD`

* Click on `DATA LIBRARY`, type "counties" on the `SEARCH` bar, select the  **`cb_2013_us_county_500k`** dataset and finally, click on `ADD LAYER`.
* Rename the new layer to "US Counties".

##### 4. 2. Click on "US Counties" layer, `ANALYSES`, `ADD ANALYSIS`

* Select `Intersect second layer`: this analysis performs a spatial intersection and aggregates the geometry values from the target layer that intersect with the geometry of the source layer..
  * Select "Railroad accidents" as `TARGET LAYER` and `SUM(total_damage)` as `OPERATION`. Apply.
  * When the analysis is done, an explanatory window will pop up. Click on `DONE`.

* First, using the map take a look on the results of the analysis: only the counties overlapping with data points are showed. Secondly, go to the dataset view to show the new column created with the previous analysis, `sum_total_damage`.

![4-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328928/86752772-58c0-11e6-9621-94dcebc33d71.png)

* *Sum Total Damage Histogram Widget*: from the same `DATA` section, check the `Add as a widget` box of the `sum_total_damage` field and `EDIT`. This will create a new histogram widget. Set the buckets to `7` and rename it as "Sum Total Damage".

* Use the autostyling and removing the visibility of the "Railroad accidents" layer. Remove auto style again. Go back to the main menu.

![4-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328931/88fc8ba2-58c0-11e6-9d72-252d3547bedd.png)

<br>

#### 5. Continue the analysis, get outliers and clusters

##### 5. 1. Click on `ADD ANALYSIS` just below "US Counties"

* Select `Detect outliers and clusters`: this analysis finds areas in your data where clusters of high values or low values exist, as well as areas which are dissimilar from their neighbors.
  * Select `sum_total_damage` as `TARGET COLUMN` and leave the rest of parameters with the default values. Apply.
  * Again, when the analysis is done, an explanatory window will pop up. Click on `DONE`.

* First, using the map show the viewer the results of the analysis: only the counties considered by the analysis as outliers or clusters are showed. Secondly, go to the dataset view to show the new columns created with the previous analysis, `quad` is the column more interesting because contains the groups that the analysis has made:

* `HH` and `LL`: clusters of high or low values surrounded by similar values
* `HL` and `LH`: outliers of high or low values surrounded by opposite values

![5-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328938/8e439bb4-58c0-11e6-8bd6-cc5f879d0e08.png)

* We are going to add a last widget, *Sum Total Damage Histogram Widget*: click on `WIDGETS`, `ADD`, `Category` and select `quads`. `CONTINUE`. Rename it as "Groups".

* Filter by `HH` and `HL` counties. Those are counties with high value of total damage surrounded by counties with also high values, and counties with high value of total damage surrounded by counties with low values. Click on `Auto style` to better distinguish them. Remove the auto style.

![5-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328939/9126bb7c-58c0-11e6-83e7-18e615cbbd63.png)

<br>

#### 6. Share and export your results

##### 6. 1. Back to the main menu, click on the three dots on the "US Counties" layer

* Select `Export data`, choose `CSV`.
* Open (with Excel or another similar software) the csv file you just download **`US_Counties.csv`**. Collapse `the_geom` column. You should have 39 counties/rows, containing only `HH` and `HL` values.

![6-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328946/975cfdd0-58c0-11e6-9f86-2c00e7b61361.png)

##### 6. 2. Back to the main menu, show the publish dialogs

* Below the map title it should show `PRIVATE`, `ADD PEOPLE` and `Map not published yet`. Let's change that.
  * First, click on `PRIVATE`, and again. Select `Link`.
  * Secondly, click on `SHARE` (at the bottom of the main menu). Click on `PUBLISH`, and then `DONE`.
  * Get the link and past it into your browser.

> The dashboard should show your "Railroad accidents" as green dots with sizes depending on the total damage. In addition, all the groups of counties will be displayed. This is because the filters and auto styling you did, it is not applied. Finally, you will have four widgets but in different order.

![6-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328947/9b4b2a5c-58c0-11e6-8e97-de7e5693c0a8.png)

* Back to the main menu, click on "US Counties" layer. Go to the `STYLE` tab. Style the layer with a `FILL` `BY VALUE`. Select `quads` as variable and choose a couple of colors that can be easily distinguished.
* Click again on `SHARE` and now in `UPDATE`.
* Now if you go back to your browser tab where you have pasted the link nothing has changed. But if you refresh the page, voilá! The colors have modified.

![6-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5215798/17328949/9e738aa8-58c0-11e6-88c8-1da87e01e342.png)

## Engine <a name="engine"></a>

### Spatial SQL  <a name="postgis"></a>

On this section you'll have the chance to test some of the most common [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/docs/reference.html) SQL procedures. To follow this section you only need to open a browser pointing to this url: [http://bl.ocks.org/ramiroaznar/raw/5a10c324dd0f4230f20db75b671a3eda/](http://bl.ocks.org/ramiroaznar/raw/5a10c324dd0f4230f20db75b671a3eda/) and change the Maps API entry point to `http://bbva00.carto.com/api/v1/map`.

![](../img/160921-geostat/sql-block.png)

From that point, you can place any valid query on the SQL panel that plays with the following datasets from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/)

* `ne_50m_land`
* `ne_adm0_europe`
* `ne_10m_populated_places_simple`
* `world_borders`

Over different examples we'll see how to make buffers, intersect or calculate lines between different features of those tables. You can paste the SQL presented on the panel, make changes and see how it works saving them using `Control+S` or `Command+S` depending on your operating system.

If no data shows on your map open the developer console and look for any errors. Usually when there's an error on your SQL statement the API will return a message that may help on finding the issue.

This section assumes some basic knowledge on SQL. If you need a bit more of help on the basics of this language take a look on [this workshop](../introductory/elections-workshop.html), there's a section on simple SQL queries.

<br>

#### Contents

- Transform to a different projection
- Get the number of points inside a polygon
- Know wether a geometry is **within** the given range from another geometry:
- Create a **buffer** from points:
- Get the **difference** between two geometries:
- Create a **straight line** between two points:
- Create **great circles** between two points:
- Generating Grids with CDB functions

For every one of these queries, we will use the same generic style:

```css
#layer['mapnik::geometry_type' = 1] {
  marker-fill: #F24440;
  marker-opacity: 0.6;
  marker-width: 8;
  marker-line-color: darken(#F24440,10);
  marker-line-width: 1;
  marker-line-opacity: 0.9;
  marker-placement: point;
  marker-allow-overlap: true;
  marker-comp-op: multiply;
}
#layer['mapnik::geometry_type'=2] {
  line-color: #F24440;
  line-width: 1.5;
  line-opacity: 1;
}
#layer['mapnik::geometry_type'=3] {
  polygon-fill: #F24440;
  polygon-opacity: 0.6;
  polygon-gamma: 0.5;
  line-color: darken(#F24440,10);
  line-width: 1;
  line-opacity: 0.5;
  line-comp-op: soft-light;
}
```

<br>

#### Transform to a different projection

```sql
SELECT
  cartodb_id,
  ST_Transform(the_geom, 54030) AS the_geom_webmercator
FROM
  ne_50m_land
```

_About [working with different projections in CARTO](http://cartodb.github.io/training/intermediate/cartocss.html#projections) and [`ST_Transform`](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_Transform.html)._

<br>

#### Get the number of points inside a polygon

Using `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT
  e.cartodb_id,
  e.admin,
  e.the_geom_webmercator,
  count(*) AS pp_count,
  sum(p.pop_max) as sum_pop
FROM
  ne_adm0_europe e
JOIN
  ne_10m_populated_places_simple p
ON
  ST_Intersects(p.the_geom, e.the_geom)
GROUP BY
  e.cartodb_id
```

Using `LATERAL`:

```sql
SELECT
  a.cartodb_id,
  a.admin AS name,
  a.the_geom_webmercator,
  counts.number_cities AS pp_count,
  counts.sum_pop
FROM
  ne_adm0_europe a
CROSS JOIN LATERAL
  (
    SELECT
      count(*) as number_cities,
      sum(pop_max) as sum_pop
    FROM
      ne_10m_populated_places_simple b
    WHERE
      ST_Intersects(a.the_geom, b.the_geom)
  ) AS counts
```

_About [`ST_Intersects`](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html) and [Lateral JOIN](http://blog.heapanalytics.com/postgresqls-powerful-new-join-type-lateral)_

----

**Note:** You know about the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` function use it to take a look on how both queries are pretty similar in terms of performance.

----

----

**Note:** Add this piece of CartoCSS (we will cover styling later) at the end so you have a nice coropleth map:

```css
#layer['mapnik::geometry_type'=3] {
  line-width: 0;
  polygon-fill: ramp([pp_count], ("#edd9a3","#f99178","#ea4f88","#a431a0","#4b2991"), quantiles(5));
}
```

----

<br>

#### Know wether a geometry is **within** the given range from another geometry:

```sql
SELECT
  a.*
FROM
  ne_10m_populated_places_simple a,
  ne_10m_populated_places_simple b
WHERE
    a.cartodb_id != b.cartodb_id
  AND ST_DWithin(
      a.the_geom_webmercator,
      b.the_geom_webmercator,
      150000
    )
  AND a.adm0name = 'Spain'
  AND b.adm0name = 'Spain'
```

In this case, we are using `the_geom_webmercator` to avoid casting to `geography` type. Calculations made with `geometry` type takes the CRS units.

Keep in mind that CRS **units in webmercator are not meters**, and they depend directly on the latitude.

_About [`ST_DWithin`](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_DWithin.html)._

<br>

#### Create a **buffer** from points:

```sql
SELECT
  cartodb_id,
  name,
  ST_Transform(
    ST_Buffer(the_geom::geography, 250000)::geometry
    ,3857
  ) AS the_geom_webmercator
FROM
  ne_10m_populated_places_simple
WHERE
  name ilike 'trondheim'
```

Compare the result with

```sql
SELECT
  cartodb_id,
  name,
  ST_Transform(
    ST_Buffer(the_geom, 2)
    ,3857
  ) AS the_geom_webmercator
FROM
  ne_10m_populated_places_simple
WHERE
  name ilike 'trondheim'
```

Why this is not a circle?

_About [`ST_Buffer`](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html)._

<br>

#### Get the **difference** between two geometries:

```sql
SELECT
  a.cartodb_id,
    ST_Difference(
        a.the_geom_webmercator,
        b.the_geom_webmercator
  ) AS the_geom_webmercator
FROM
  ne_50m_land a,
  ne_adm0_europe b
WHERE
  b.adm0_a3 like 'ESP'
```

_About [`ST_Difference`](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_Difference.html)._

<br>

#### Create a **straight line** between two points:

```sql
SELECT
  ST_MakeLine(
    a.the_geom_webmercator,
    b.the_geom_webmercator
  ) as the_geom_webmercator
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM ne_10m_populated_places_simple
    WHERE name ILIKE 'madrid'
  ) as a,
  (
    SELECT * FROM ne_10m_populated_places_simple
    WHERE name ILIKE 'barcelona'AND adm0name ILIKE 'spain'
  ) as b
```

_About [`ST_MakeLine`](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakeLine.html)._

<br>

#### Create **great circles** between two points:

```sql
SELECT
  ST_Transform(
    ST_Segmentize(
      ST_Makeline(
        a.the_geom,
        b.the_geom
      )::geography,
      100000
    )::geometry,
  3857
  ) as the_geom_webmercator
FROM
  (SELECT * FROM ne_10m_populated_places_simple
  WHERE name ILIKE 'madrid') as a,
  (SELECT * FROM ne_10m_populated_places_simple
  WHERE name ILIKE 'new york') as b
```

#### Generating Grids with CDB functions

##### Rectangular grid

```sql
SELECT
  row_number() over () as cartodb_id,
  CDB_RectangleGrid(
    ST_Buffer(the_geom_webmercator,125000),
  250000,
  250000
  ) AS the_geom_webmercator
FROM
  ne_adm0_europe
WHERE
  adm0_a3 IN ('ITA','GBR')
```

_About [CDB_RectangleGrid](http://docs.cartodb.com/tips-and-tricks/cartodb-functions/#a-rectangle-grid)_

##### Adaptative Hexagonal grid

```sql
WITH grid AS (
  SELECT
    row_number() over () as cartodb_id,
    CDB_HexagonGrid(
      ST_Buffer(the_geom_webmercator, 100000),
      100000
    ) AS the_geom_webmercator
  FROM
    ne_adm0_europe
  WHERE
    adm0_a3 IN ('ESP','ITA')
)
SELECT
  grid.the_geom_webmercator,

### Style with Turbo-Carto <a name="turbocarto"></a>

#### CartoCSS & Turbo-Carto

[CartoCSS](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/cartocss/) is the syntax language that enables you to customize the style of your map data. Similar to working with a Cascading Style Sheet for styling webpages, CartoCSS is specific to the design of map symbolizer properties (such as marker size, marker color, line stroke, text display, and so on). You can apply CartoCSS styles directly from the the Map View of the CARTO Builder. [Here](http://cartodb.github.io/training/intermediate/cartocss.html#cartocss) you can find an intermediate workshop about designing with CartoCSS. If you are interested in knowing about how to color maps, there are two lessons ([1st part](https://carto.com/academy/courses/intermediate-design/choose-colors-1/) & [2nd part](https://carto.com/academy/courses/intermediate-design/choose-colors-2/)) in CARTO Map Academy.

[Turbo Carto](https://carto.com/blog/styling-with-turbo-carto/) allows you to create color and symbol size ramps with just a single line of code, so you don’t need to worry anymore about calculating the correct bins for your thematic map. It does it for you. Turbo Carto is built around the idea of ramps. You can apply a ramp to any traditional CartoCSS property used to define a map symbol’s size (-width), color (-fill), and even opacity (-opacity) based off an attribute in your data. No matter which CartoCSS property you are ramping, Turbo Carto has a standard syntax you can follow:

```css
#layer { 
  property: ramp([attribute], (values), (filters), "mapping"); 
}
```

* `property`: the CartoCSS property you want to ramp with Turbo Carto
* `attribute`: the attribute in your data you want to symbolize
* `values`: how the attribute values will be styled (by color, by size, etc.)
* `filters`: defines which values are assigned to which attribute values
* `mapping`: defines how filters are applied (=,>=,<=,>,<)

<br>

#### Contents

- Symbol size ramp
- Color ramp

### Exploring CARTO Engine APIs <a name="apis"></a>

This section covers the basic usage of main [CARTO Engine APIs](carto.com/docs). Using a software called [Postman](http://getpostman.com) you'll be able to experiment with the different APIs and see how to interact directly with the platform. This is specially useful if you are going to do it from a different environment than JavaScript, as it will be covered on the last part of this workshop.

Setting up your environment:

* Open your Postman installation (normally a Google Chrome extension)
* Install a new collection from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ernesmb/CARTO-Engine-collection/master/CARTO_Training_Collection.postman_collection.json)
* Download the environment provided by the instructor (see the shared notes doc)

![](../img/160921-geostat/postman.png)

<br>

#### [SQL API](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/sql-api/)

This is the API to interact directly with your database. You can perform not just any SELECT query but also create tables, add triggers and functions.

#### [Maps API](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/maps-api/)

The Maps API is the rendering engine for CARTO. This API needs in essence a query and a cartographic symbology definition to render tiles to be used on your web mapping applications. When datasets are public (as in Free accounts) you can specify queries and CartoCSS directly on your call. When private datasets are involved, then you need to define a template and give it a name to be instantiated by the final users.

#### [Import API](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/import-api/)

To upload bulk data to CARTO you need to use the Import API. This provides mechanisms to upload files or define the url from where CARTO will fetch your data and create tables on your account.
