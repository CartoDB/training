## Builder <a name="builder"></a>

![](../img/161011-ism-carto/builder.png)

The Builder is the new main web interface to interact with the CARTO platform. It's a product aimed to everyone willing to manage, analyze and visualize geospatial information. It's highly focused on usability, with a friendly graphical interface that unlocks all the power of the CARTO Engine without having to know all the details on underlying technologies such as PostGIS or CartoCSS.

## Demo <a name="demo"></a>

### 1. Import datasets and create a map

#### 1. 1. Import datasets into CARTO

* Download the following datasets from the `builder-demo` account:
  * [`vertidos`](https://team.carto.com/u/builder-demo/tables/vertidos/public) (as csv file), pollution point sources.
  * [`rios`](https://team.carto.com/u/builder-demo/tables/rios/public) (as shapefile file), Spanish rivers.
  * [`subcuencas`](https://team.carto.com/u/builder-demo/tables/subcuencas_nivel_0/public) (as shapefile), small Spanish rivers watersheds.

* Import the three datasets (one by one) into your CARTO account.

* Select `vertidos`, `rios` and `subcuencas` from your datasets dashboard, click on `NEW MAP`.

#### 1. 2. Rename map title and layers

* Rename map title to **`Vertidos, ríos y subcuencas`**.
* Order the layers: first `vertidos`, then `rios` and at the bottom, `subcuencas`.
* Rename layers: 
  * `vertidos` as `Vertidos`,
  * `rios` as `Ríos`,
  * `subcuencas` as `Subcuencas`.

<br>

### 2. Style `Vertidos` layer and add your first widgets

#### 2. 1. Add your first widgets

* Click on `Vertidos` layer.
* On the `DATA` taba, you will be able to see an overview of all the fields that this layer contains.
  1. Activate the checkbox of `points count`.
  2. Click on `EDIT`.
  3. Rename the widget as `Número de vertidos`.

> This widget is a formula which counts the number of points (vertidos) within the visualization bounding box. Try to add a widget which filters rivers by name.

#### 2. 1. Style `Vertidos` layer

* Back to the main menu, in order to style `Vertidos` layer follow these steps:
  1. Click on `Vertidos` layer.
  2. Click on the `STYLE` tab. 
  3. Click on the number 7 next to `FILL` and set the marker size to `BY VALUE`.
  4. Select `volumen_m`. Leave the min and max default values.
  5. Click on the color bar and set the `opacity` to `0.5`.
  6. Set the `STROKE` to `0`.

> You have just created a bubble map! Larger points are "vertidos" with higher "volumen", and smaller points are "vertidos" with lower "volumen".

### 2. Filter rivers by watersheds

#### 2. 1. Connect `Rios` and `Subcuencas` layers

* In order to connect these two datasets, we need a common field. In our case, `cod_demar`. Then, we need to apply the `Filter by layer` analysis. Please, follow these steps:
  1. Back to the main menu, click on `Rios` layer.
  2. Click on `ANALYSIS` tab.
  3. Click on `ADD NEW ANALYSIS`.
  4. Select `Filter by layer` analysis. Click on `ADD ANALYSIS`.
  5. Set the parameters as follow:
    * `FILTER BY LAYER`: `Subcuencas`.
    * `SOURCE COLUMN`: `cod_demar`.
    * `FILTER COLUMN`: `cod_demar`.

#### 2. 2. Add a widget in order to filter `Rios` by `Subcuencas`

* You have both layers connected by the `cod_demar`. Now you would only need to add a category widget for filtering by this field:
  1. Back to the main menu, click on `cod_demar` layer.
  2. Activate the checkbox of `cod_demar`.
  3. Click on `EDIT`.
  4. Rename the widget as `Demarcación`.
* Because we are only interested on the rivers that crosses the Comunidad de Madrid where the "vertidos" are located, we will click on `31` value (Tajo river watershed).
